# minimise-maximise
When playing SoF in fullscreen at lower resolutions e.g. 640x480 - you must now navigate around your desktop at this resolution unless you quit SoF.exe. 

With this script running in the background, any time you leave SoF by alt+tab or pressing the windows key it will minimise and resize your desktop to its default value. This will also minimise the SoF window if you're playing in windowed mode.
